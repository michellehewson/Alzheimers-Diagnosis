# Alzheimer's Diagnosis Project
## Final Project for Fall 2023 AC209A @ Harvard University

This project aims to understand how different factors affect whether a person develops dementia. Various ML models are utilized, and the goal of each model is to predict the presence of dementia based on training parameters such as gender, socioeconomic status, age, number of years of education, MMSE score, eTIV, nWBV, and ASF.
